# PyBer_Analysis



### Overview of the analysis :

Pyber is a ride sharing company.  The company would like to know the ride-sharing data by city type.  We will generate a summary DataFrame to show the ride, driver and fare differences based on city types, i.e., Urban, Suburban, and Rural.  The company also would like to see the fare change along 4 month period.  We use Pandas and Matplotlib to the results visually.



### Results:

The ride data clearly shows the difference based on city type of Rural, Suburban, and Urban, summarized in the following table.  The total rides in Urban area is the most, Rural area is the least and Suburban is in the middle.  The drivers in Urban area are most available because of the highest total drivers count, following by the Suburban area, and there are much less drivers in Rural area.  People in Urban area spend much more money on ride sharing, comparing to the next two, Suburban and Rural.  The average fare per ride dramatically reduced in Urban area, compared to Rural area, due to the facts of shorter distance and more service demand.  The average fare per driver follows the same trend with the similar reasons, including more availability of drivers.

The total weekly fare in the period of January, 2019 to April, 2019 is shown in the figure.  The Urban areas have the most weekly fares in this period, the Suburban is the second, the lowest is in Rural areas.

### Summary: 

Based on these results, we have three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing those disparities among the city types.

1. Give incentives to drivers for them to pick more sharing requests in Rural areas.
2. Launch an advertisement campaign to let more people in rural areas aware of the ride sharing services;
3. Lower the ride fares per mile in rural area to encourage more people in rural areas to use the ride sharing services.
